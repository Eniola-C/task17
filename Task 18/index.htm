                  Investors should carefully assess the risks associated with bond ETF 
                  investments. Bond ETF performance may not precisely mirror the 
                  underlying index due to tracking errors from factors like bond 
                  weighting differences, transaction costs, and timing. 
                  Management fees can affect overall returns. 
                  Bond ETFs expose investors to risks, including interest rate risk, 
                  potentially leading to capital losses as rising rates decrease 
                  underlying bond values. Most bond ETFs lack a fixed maturity date or 
                  guaranteed principal repayment at maturity. Bond ETFs may generate 
                  capital gains from portfolio rebalancing, 
                  potentially resulting in unexpected tax liabilities. <br><br>
                  Credit risk is a concern, as bond issuers’ financial health can impact
                  ETF value. Some bond ETFs may use derivatives, introducing counterparty
                  risk where losses can occur if a counterparty fails to fulfill its 
                  contractual obligations. Call risk should also be considered, as 
                  falling interest rates might prompt callable bond issuers to repay 
                  securities before maturity, 
                  forcing reinvestment in lower-yield or riskier securities. <br><br>
                  Savings accounts are typically FDIC-insured. 
                  The Automated Bond Portfolio is covered by SIPC, 
                  which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 
                  (including $250,000 for claims for cash). Explanatory brochure available 
                  upon request or at www.sipc.org. It does not 
                  provide protection against losses resulting from market fluctuations. <br><br>
                  Bond ETFs are less liquid than cash, potentially affecting buying and 
                  selling shares at desired prices. Some may prefer the stability and 
                  accessibility of savings or deposit accounts despite lower yields. <br><br>
                  Equities may offer higher long-term gains than bonds or cash investments, 
                  providing capital appreciation and reinvestable dividend income. 
                  However, equities present increased risk due to market fluctuations and 
                  short-term price volatility. Investors with longer time horizons and 
                  higher risk tolerance may allocate a portion of their portfolios to 
                  equities, acknowledging the possibility of gains and losses. 
                  Investors should weigh these risks before investing.
                   Past performance does not guarantee future results. <br><br>
                   Tax loss harvesting may generate a higher number of trades due to 
                   attempts to capture losses. There is a chance that trading attributed 
                   to tax loss harvesting may create capital gains and wash sales and could
                    be subject to higher transaction costs and market impacts. 
                    In addition, tax loss harvesting strategies may produce losses, 
                    which may not be offset by sufficient gains in the account and may be 
                    limited to a $3,000 deduction against income. The utilization of losses
                     harvested through the strategy will depend upon the recognition of 
                     capital gains in the same or a future tax period, and in addition may
                      be subject to limitations under applicable tax laws, e.g., 
                      if there are insufficient realized gains in the tax period, 
                      the use of harvested losses may be limited to a $3,000 deduction 
                      against income and distributions. Losses harvested through the 
                      strategy that are not utilized in the tax period when recognized 
                      (e.g., because of insufficient capital gains and/or significant 
                      capital loss carryforwards), generally may 
                   be carried forward to offset future capital gains, if any. <br><br>
                   All investing involves risk, including the possible loss of money you 
                   invest, and past performance does not guarantee future performance.
